# Popular Movies

This is the first & second project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. 
In Stage 1 the App contains the core experiences, like a Main Discrovery Screen width a list of movies, a Details View of a selected movie and Sort Settings (Most Popular & Top Rated). Stage 2 expanded the functions by the possibility to view and play trailers, read reviews, mark a movie as a favorite (new sorting criteria: My Favorites) and added a tablet support.

## Getting Started

The App uses an [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API. To build the App you have to replace the variable `TMDbKeyProp` in gradle.properties with your own like below:

```
TMDbKeyProp=YOUR_API_KEY
```
