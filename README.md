This is the first project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. In Stage 1 the App contains the core experiences, like a Main Discrovery Screen, a Details View and Sort Settings.

For more info about the project please check the Udacity [Implementation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true).

## Getting Started

The App uses an [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API. To build the App you have to replace the variable 'TMDbKeyProp' in gradle.properties with your own like below:

```
TMDbKeyProp=[YOUR_API_KEY]
```
